# MyComposer
MyComposer is an application that allows users to compose songs and export them as .midi files.

## Important
A list of the recently opened files is saved to the Documents folder in a folder called MyComposer.

**If you have a file named `recents.txt` within a folder called MyComposer in the Documents folder, this file will be written over.**

# Features

## Layers

In MyComposer, **layers** can store and play one note at a time. However, many layers can be added to a song, allowing for multiple notes to be played at the same time.

Click on the + icon on the left side of the screen to add a new layer.

Once a layer has been added, it can be edited by double-clicking on it.

## Notes and Drum Beats

**Notes** and **drum beats** can be added by clicking on an empty cell in the grid. This will open a popup menu prompting the user to create a new note or drum beat.
